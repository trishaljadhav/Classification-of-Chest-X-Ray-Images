Compared performance of a simple CNN versus a Transfer Learning model to classify chest X-Rays as images of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, lung opacity or normal patients. The InceptionResNetV2 model gave a high recall value of 88% for the COVID-19 patients and a high precision value of 84% for normal patients, maximizing usability in a real-world scenario.
